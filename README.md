## 📸 How It Works

1. **User visits home.html** → Displays a form to enter a city name
2. **Form submission** → Sends request to weather.jsp
3. **weather.jsp processes** → Fetches weather data from API
4. **Results displayed** → Shows temperature, conditions, and other details

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **404 Not Found** | Ensure the app is deployed correctly in Tomcat's webapps folder |
| **JSP not rendering** | Check that Tomcat version supports JSP and that WEB-INF/web.xml is present |
| **Weather data not loading** | Verify internet connection and external API availability |
| **Port already in use** | Change Tomcat port in `conf/server.xml` (default: 8080) |
